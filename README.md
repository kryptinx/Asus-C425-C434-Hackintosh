## Asus-C425/434-Hackintosh

**Credits to @meghan06 and his/her repo https://github.com/meghan06/ChromebookOSX. It helped me tremendously, and this would not have been possible without them. I strongly suggest you to star/contribute to their repo. It's a really in depth guide and helped me a lot.**

### What Works:
- Everything except speaker/mic and SD Card reader slot.


### Setup Process:
If you want to use my EFI, make sure you download CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS and generate a pair of serials to use. The config.plist uploaded has been sanitized, so you will have to do this to ensure full functioning. I am not responsible for any blacklisted Apple IDs.

Make sure to create the 2 recovery dmg's in `com.apple.recovery.boot` for macOS Monterey. The Dortania guide goes over it.

Also make sure to follow meghan06's guide to enable itlwm in recovery or else you wont be able to install macOS.

You can ignore the ventura title, it applies to all OS'es. 


Good luck!
Once again, thank you so much @meghan06 for the time and effort you put in this repo.
